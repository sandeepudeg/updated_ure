# Requirements Document: Unified Rural Ecosystem (URE)

## Introduction

The Unified Rural Ecosystem (URE) is an AI-powered platform designed to serve rural communities in India by providing intelligent, multi-agent assistance for agricultural, policy, and resource management. The system leverages Amazon Bedrock and Strands Agents SDK to orchestrate specialized AI agents that address farmer needs across three primary domains: agricultural expertise, government policy navigation, and resource optimization.

The architecture uses a supervisor-worker pattern where the Strands Supervisor Agent (powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet) routes requests to three specialist agents: Agri-Expert, Policy-Navigator, and Resource-Optimizer. All data is grounded in official Indian government datasets via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

- Primary Value: Delivering actionable, resource-efficient, and sustainable advice

TASK:
Analyze the user's input to determine which specialized Strands Agent(s) are required:
1. [AGRI_AGENT]: For crop health, pest IDs, or market price requests
2. [GOVT_POLICY_AGENT]: For subsidies, welfare schemes, or document help
3. [RESOURCE_AGENT]: For water management, solar energy logs, or weather planning

EXECUTION STEPS:
1. CLASSIFY: Identify the domain of the query
2. DELEGATE: Pass the intent and relevant data (like S3 file paths) to the specific agent
3. SYNTHESIZE: If multiple agents are involved, merge their outputs into a "Life-Plan"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use simple, non-technical language (avoid words like 'optimization' or 'parameters')
- Always suggest the lowest-cost option first to ensure sustainability
- If the query is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question about their specific location or crop
```

### Agri-Expert Agent Personality

The Agri-Expert operates as a Senior Agricultural Scientist specializing in Indian conditions:
- Identifies 50+ common Indian crop diseases via image analysis using PlantVillage dataset grounding
- Masters Integrated Pest Management (IPM) focusing on organic/low-cost interventions
- Understands real-time Mandi (market) dynamics via Agmarknet API integration
- Provides treatment recommendations: Organic first, then low-cost chemical, chemical as last resort
- Uses `fetch_mandi_prices` tool for district-specific market data
- Recommends best "Net Profit" option (Price minus estimated transport cost)
- Tone: Supportive, like a wise village elder who understands modern science

**System Prompt for Agri-Expert:**
```
You are a Senior Agricultural Scientist specializing in Indian soil and climate conditions.

KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN:
- Expertise in identifying 50+ common Indian crop diseases via image analysis
- Mastery of IPM (Integrated Pest Management) focusing on organic/low-cost interventions
- Real-time understanding of Mandi (market) dynamics

INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS (S3 INPUT):
When an image is provided from the S3 bucket:
1. Identify: State the likely disease or nutrient deficiency
2. Probability: Give a confidence level (e.g., "I am 80% sure this is Late Blight")
3. Actionable Fix:
   - Immediate Step: (e.g., "Remove the infected leaves immediately")
   - Low-Cost Treatment: (e.g., "Mix neem oil with soap water")
   - Chemical Option: Only suggest as a last resort

MARKET LINKAGE LOGIC:
If the user asks about selling crops:
1. Use the `fetch_mandi_prices` tool for their district
2. Compare the price at the nearest 3 Mandis
3. Suggest the best "Net Profit" option (Price minus estimated transport cost)

TONE:
Supportive, like a wise village elder who understands modern science
```

### Resource-Optimizer Agent Logic

The Resource-Optimizer operates as a Sustainability Intelligence Agent:
- Receives JSON logs from S3 containing soil_moisture_index (0.0-1.0), weather_forecast, electricity_availability
- Applies deterministic logic: If moisture > 0.7, advise AGAINST irrigation
- If moisture < 0.3 and rain predicted within 12 hours, advise "Wait for rain"
- Cross-references electricity hours to suggest optimal pump operation times
- Provides "Daily Resource Plan" with specific "Stop/Start" instructions
- Maximizes crop yield while minimizing water and electricity usage
- Uses Python-based code interpreter for mathematical models (e.g., Evapotranspiration calculations)

**System Prompt for Resource-Optimizer:**
```
You are a Sustainability Intelligence Agent. Your goal is to maximize crop yield while minimizing water and electricity usage.

DATA HANDLING:
You will receive JSON logs from S3 containing:
- soil_moisture_index: (0.0 to 1.0)
- weather_forecast: (Probability of rain, Temperature)
- electricity_availability: (Hours of grid power)

REASONING PROCESS:
1. Check the moisture level. If above 0.7, strictly advise AGAINST irrigation
2. If moisture is low (<0.3), check the weather forecast. If rain is predicted within 12 hours, advise "Wait for rain" to save water/energy
3. If irrigation is needed, cross-reference with electricity hours to suggest the best time to turn on pumps

OUTPUT:
Provide a "Daily Resource Plan" with specific "Stop/Start" instructions
```

### Policy-Navigator Agent Approach

The Policy-Navigator operates as a Government Scheme Expert:
- Performs RAG on government scheme PDFs from Bedrock Knowledge Base
- Matches farmers to relevant schemes (PM-Kisan, PKVY, etc.) based on their situation
- Provides eligibility criteria, application process, subsidy amounts, and deadlines
- Ensures responses are grounded in official data without hallucination
- Coordinates with Agri-Expert when disease-specific subsidies are available
- Uses citations from Knowledge Base to show exact source of information

**System Prompt for Policy-Navigator:**
```
You are a Legal & Welfare Officer specializing in Indian government schemes.

ROLE:
Search the Bedrock Knowledge Base to find the exact eligibility criteria for schemes. Perform RAG on government scheme PDFs from data.gov.in.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Match farmers to relevant schemes (PM-Kisan, PKVY, etc.) based on their situation
2. Provide eligibility criteria, application process, subsidy amounts, and deadlines
3. Ensure responses are grounded in official data without hallucination
4. Always cite the source document and page number from the Knowledge Base
5. Coordinate with Agri-Expert when disease-specific subsidies are available

TONE:
Clear, professional, and farmer-first. Simplify legal language into actionable steps
```

## Competitive Positioning

The URE system differentiates from existing agritech platforms through:

### Modularity
The supervisor-worker architecture is "pluggable"—additional agents (Education, Healthcare) can be added using the same framework without changing core infrastructure.

### Multi-Agent Synthesis
Unlike siloed apps (one for weather, another for schemes), URE synthesizes cross-domain expertise in single responses. The Supervisor doesn't just call agents sequentially; it orchestrates them to deliver holistic recommendations.

### Low-Code Scalability
Using Strands SDK enables easier updates and scaling compared to rigid codebases of older agritech startups. New agents can be added by defining system prompts and tools without rewriting infrastructure.

### Contextual Synthesis
The system doesn't just provide three separate tools; it orchestrates them to deliver holistic recommendations. When a farmer asks a complex question, the Supervisor automatically determines which agents to invoke and synthesizes their outputs.

### Proactive vs. Reactive
Existing apps wait for user queries. URE's architecture (using AWS Lambda and S3 triggers) allows for proactive alerts. If sensor data in S3 shows a drop in soil moisture, the Resource-Agent notifies the user before the crop is stressed.

### Orchestration vs. Simple Search
While a bot like Kisan e-Mitra answers policy questions, URE's Strands Supervisor can reason across domains. If the Agri-Agent detects a pest, the Supervisor automatically triggers the Policy-Agent to check for subsidies on the recommended organic pesticide without the user asking.

### Example Winning Scenario
A farmer asks "What should I plant given water shortage and current government subsidies?" The system:
1. Calls Resource-Optimizer Agent for water availability analysis
2. Calls Policy-Navigator for subsidy-eligible crops
3. Calls Agri-Expert for market prices
4. Supervisor synthesizes: "Plant X (drought-resistant, 20% subsidy available, current market price ₹Y, irrigation needed only 2x per month)"

### Competitive Landscape (2025-2026)

| Solution Category | Key Players | Their Focus | URE's Competitive Advantage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pure Advisory Apps** | AgroStar, DeHaat, Kisan Suvidha | Large-scale, expert-led or rule-based crop advice | Contextual Cross-Talk: Links pest diagnosis directly to government subsidy search without user prompting |
| **Agentic Platforms** | Cropin "Orion", Tech Mahindra "Orion" | Enterprise-grade "Agentic AI" for supply chains | Community-Centric: Built for rural ecosystem, focusing on resource-efficiency (water/electricity) rather than just corporate yield |
| **Government Bots** | Kisan e-Mitra, AgriGOI | Information retrieval for schemes and grievances | Multimodal Reasoning: Processes images (pests) and sensor data (moisture) to provide holistic "Life-Plan" |
| **IoT/Precision Ag** | Fasal, BharatAgri | Use IoT sensors and AI for precision irrigation | Synthesis: Combines disease detection, market prices, and resource optimization in one response |

### Why URE Wins the Professional Track

1. **Verification Loop**: Uses Bedrock Guardrails to prevent "hallucinations" in policy advice—a common flaw in competitors using basic LLM wrappers
2. **Explainability**: Agents show their reasoning (e.g., "Based on 35°C temperature and 10% humidity, I calculated high evaporation rate...")
3. **Scalability**: Serverless architecture (Lambda, Bedrock, S3) scales from 10 to 10,000 users without infrastructure changes
4. **Sovereignty**: Can migrate to sovereign LLMs (like BharatGen) to ensure data privacy and cultural nuance

## Responsible AI and Governance

### Responsible AI Parameters for Agriculture Applications

**Fairness**
- Ensure recommendations (fertilizer use, irrigation schedules, crop selection) are unbiased across farm sizes, regions, and socio-economic groups
- Avoid favoring large-scale farms over smallholders
- Example: AI should not recommend expensive inputs only accessible to wealthy farmers

**Reliability & Safety**
- Models must handle uncertainty in weather, soil, and market data
- Fail-safe design: if confidence is low, flag for human agronomist review
- Example: Avoid overconfident pesticide recommendations that could harm crops or ecosystems

**Privacy & Security**
- Protect farmer identity, land ownership records, and yield data
- Use secure data-sharing protocols (e.g., federated learning for soil data)
- Example: Farmer-specific yield predictions should not be exposed to competitors or buyers without consent

**Inclusiveness**
- Design for farmers with varying literacy and digital access
- Support local languages (Marathi, Hindi, Kannada, etc.)
- Provide voice-based interfaces for low-literacy users

**Transparency**
- Explain why a recommendation was made (e.g., "Based on rainfall forecast and soil nitrogen levels, apply 20kg urea")
- Show data sources (satellite, IoT sensors, government guidelines)
- Example: Farmers should see the reasoning behind crop rotation advice

**Accountability**
- Keep audit trails of recommendations and farmer decisions
- Responsibility remains with the farmer/agronomist—AI is a copilot, not a decision-maker
- Example: If AI suggests irrigation and farmer disagrees, the override is logged

**Sustainability**
- Encourage eco-friendly practices (reduced chemical use, water conservation, biodiversity)
- Align with UN SDGs and local agricultural policies
- Example: AI should prioritize organic pest control methods when feasible

### Implementation of Responsible AI

1. **Input Filtering**: Bedrock Guardrails detect "Prompt Injection" or requests for restricted topics (illegal chemical recipes)
2. **Output Grounding**: Guardrails verify agent responses are found in Knowledge Base; blocks hallucinated schemes
3. **PII Redaction**: Automatically detects and masks sensitive data (Aadhaar numbers, bank details) in conversation history
4. **Denied Topics Configuration**:
   - Chemical Hazards: Block advice on creating unregulated or dangerous homemade pesticides
   - Financial Coaching: Policy-Agent explains eligibility but does not give investment advice
   - Hate Speech & Polarization: Filter responses in regional languages for cultural sensitivity
5. **Explainability Logging**: Every agent decision is logged with reasoning for audit trails and compliance

---

## Implementation Architecture and Data Flow

### End-to-End Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: User uploads a leaf photo → Stored in Amazon S3 (knowledge-base-bharat bucket)
2. **Routing**: Strands Supervisor sees the image → Signals the Agri-Expert Agent
3. **Processing**: 
   - Agri-Expert pulls image from S3
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet identifies disease (e.g., "Yellow Rust")
   - Policy-Navigator Agent simultaneously checks for "Yellow Rust Subsidies" via Bedrock Knowledge Base
4. **Delivery**: Supervisor combines both answers: "You have Yellow Rust. Use Neem Oil. Also, you can claim a 20% subsidy on organic pesticides under the PM-Kisan scheme."

### Multimodal RAG Pattern (Visual Grounding)

The Agri-Expert uses a "Visual RAG" approach:
1. **Input**: Farmer uploads a query image of their crop
2. **Visual Search**: Lambda function uses Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings to generate vector representation
3. **Retrieval**: System searches S3-backed vector database (Amazon OpenSearch) to find 3 most similar images from PlantVillage dataset
4. **Grounding**: Both farmer's image and 3 reference images sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet with system prompt
5. **Output**: Agent identifies disease and provides treatment from verified metadata

### Knowledge Base Integration

1. **Data Ingestion**: CSV/PDF datasets stored in S3 bucket (knowledge-base-bharat)
2. **Indexing**: Bedrock Knowledge Base indexes agricultural datasets using vector database (Pinecone or OpenSearch)
3. **Retrieval**: When farmer asks about crop price, Strands Agent uses retrieval_tool to query Knowledge Base
4. **Grounding**: Responses grounded in official data from Agmarknet, data.gov.in, IMD, and AgriFieldNet

### Memory Management

**Short-Term (Session) Memory**:
- Strands Agents use ConversationManager that keeps recent messages
- Supervisor remembers context (e.g., "5 acres of wheat") across agent calls
- Uses FileSessionManager for local testing or S3SessionManager for cloud deployment

**Long-Term (Persistent) Memory**:
- Episodic Memory: Stores summaries of past sessions for continuity
- Semantic Memory: Uses Vector Store (OpenSearch/Chroma) to search through historical facts
- Cross-Agent Memory: Supervisor acts as central memory hub, passing context between agents

### Strands SDK Integration

The Strands Agents SDK provides:
- **Agent Initialization**: Define agents with system prompts and tool access
- **Tool Calling**: Agents use @tool decorator to wrap API calls and database queries
- **Agentic Loop**: Agents observe, plan, act, and reflect on outcomes
- **Session Management**: Built-in conversation and state management
- **Code Interpreter**: Agents can run Python code for mathematical models (e.g., Evapotranspiration calculations)
